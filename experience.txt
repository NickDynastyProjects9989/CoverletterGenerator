Proficient in AI-driven automation, data science deployments, and cloud-based ML solutions, I specialize in SQL, Python, and statistical modeling for data analysis, decision-making, and business intelligence optimization. With a strong background in Azure Machine Learning, AWS SageMaker, Databricks, and MLOps, I have successfully driven AI-powered automation in industries such as finance, healthcare, and business analytics.

Currently, as a Data Scientist at Service Oriented Solutions LLC, I design and deploy end-to-end credit risk prediction systems using Python, FastAPI, and AWS Lambda, leading to a 20% improvement in loan approval efficiency. I have developed real-time credit scoring APIs using XGBoost and TensorFlow, reducing response times and ensuring seamless financial application integration. Additionally, I implemented MLOps pipelines with GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Docker, automating model deployment and cutting retraining downtime by 40%.

Previously, at the University at Albany's Council on Research, I built an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with LangChain, FastAPI, and OpenAI GPT-3.5, increasing essay classification accuracy by 25%. I also designed RESTful APIs for document processing, optimized research model tracking via Power BI dashboards, and developed secure data pipelines with Azure Data Factory and SQL Server to ensure FERPA-compliant encryption of sensitive student data.

At Golub Capital LLC, I worked as a Junior Data Scientist, where I built machine learning clustering models to segment sponsors in a $60 billion asset portfolio, identifying high-value strategic partners. I led A/B testing for portfolio reallocation strategies, reducing investment risk by 15%, and developed Power BI dashboards that streamlined sponsor investment behavior analysis, cutting manual reporting time by 40%. Additionally, I designed enterprise data models for risk assessment and revenue forecasting and optimized SQL stored procedures for real-time analytics across SQL Server, Hive, and Azure Data Lake.

During my tenure as a Data Scientist at the Office of Mental Health (OMH), I developed an AI-powered chatbot with LangChain and GPT-4, achieving a 90% accuracy rate in mental health recommendations. I deployed the chatbot using Azure ML and Docker, reducing response latency by 30%. Additionally, I migrated a legacy SAS-based risk model to SQL, improving data retrieval efficiency by 40%, and designed a real-time Tableau monitoring system for mental health interventions, reducing data retrieval times by 50%.

At Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), as a Data Science Analyst, I spearheaded data-driven decision-making initiatives by analyzing large datasets with SQL and Python, reducing manual processing in financial reporting. I developed Power BI dashboards for real-time operational KPI tracking and implemented automated ETL pipelines, cutting data entry errors by 30%. I also built a fraud detection model using Anomaly Detection and NLP, improving transaction security by 25%, and deployed an MLOps framework with CI/CD pipelines, ensuring 99.9% system uptime for AI models.

I hold a Master of Science in Data Science from the State University of New York, Albany, with a focus on Statistical Machine Learning, AI, NLP, and Predictive Modeling. My passion lies in leveraging AI and cloud-based technologies to build scalable, automated, and data-driven solutions across industries.
